# Vuejs Tasks

## Chapter 5 

Start by creating an array of “Mayor” candidates.

Each candidate has a “name” and a number of “votes”. 

Use a button to increase the count of votes for each candidate. 

Use a computed property to determine who is the current “Mayor”, and display his name.

Finally when key ‘c’ is pressed the elections start from the beginning, and all votes become 0.
